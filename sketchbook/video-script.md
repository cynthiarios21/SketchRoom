**Total Duration:** 2:30
**Goal:** Hook judges immediately with hand interactions, then show social.

---

### 0:00 - 0:30 | The Hook: Magic Hands
*   **Visual:** First-person view (POV). The user is in a clean, white void. They look at their hands—no controllers.
*   **Action:** The user pinches the air and pulls. A vibrant, glowing 3D line follows their finger. They draw a quick spiral around them.
*   **Audio (Voiceover):** "Imagine drawing in 3D space, with nothing but your hands. No controllers, no barriers. Just you and your creativity."
*   **Text Overlay:** PURE HAND TRACKING

### 0:30 - 1:00 | The UI: Intuitive Control
*   **Visual:** User stops drawing. They flip their left hand palm-up. A sleek, floating menu animates open above their palm.
*   **Action:** With their right index finger, they poke a bright blue color button, then a "Thick Brush" icon. The button pulses on touch.
*   **Audio:** "Our Contextual Spatial UI appears only when you need it. Change colors, adjust brushes, and undo mistakes with a simple touch."
*   **Text Overlay:** SPATIAL UI

### 1:00 - 1:45 | The Social: Better Together
*   **Visual:** A second avatar (simple stylized head and hands) pops into existence nearby.
*   **Action:** The second user waves. The first user waves back. Then, they start building together. One draws a house structure, the other adds trees and details.
*   **Audio:** "Creativity is better shared. Connect instantly with friends. See their avatars, watch them create in real-time, and build worlds together."
*   **Text Overlay:** REAL-TIME COLLABORATION

### 1:45 - 2:15 | Advanced Mechanics: Grab & Scale
*   **Visual:** The user reaches out with *both* hands to grab the house they just built.
*   **Action:** They pull their hands apart, and the entire house scales up to become massive. They rotate it like a physical object.
*   **Audio:** "Manipulate your world naturally. Two-handed interactions allow you to scale and rotate your creations as if they were real objects."
*   **Text Overlay:** TWO-HANDED MANIPULATION

### 2:15 - 2:30 | Outro
*   **Visual:** Camera pulls back to show the complex scene they built together. Fade to logo.
*   **Audio:** "Collaborative 3D Sketchbook. Built with the Immersive Web SDK. Available now on Meta Horizon."
*   **Text Overlay:** URL: sketchbook.demo | Built with IWSDK
